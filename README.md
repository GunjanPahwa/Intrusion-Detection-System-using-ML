📝 Project Explanation:

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are crucial for protecting networks from unauthorized access and cyberattacks.
This project demonstrates how Machine Learning can be used to automatically analyze network traffic and detect potential threats with high accuracy.

By training models on the KDD Cup 1999 dataset, the system learns to recognize normal behavior and various types of attacks like DoS (Denial of Service) or Probe attempts.
Among the models tested, Random Forest performed best — showing that ensemble learning techniques can effectively handle complex and imbalanced security data.

This project highlights how data-driven approaches can enhance cybersecurity and serve as a foundation for real-time intrusion detection systems.
